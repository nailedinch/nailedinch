***Larcis/Lars (–õ–∞—Ä—Ü–∏—Å/–õ–∞—Ä—Ü), rarely called Nin***  
*rus/self taught eng, so there's no such thing as grammar to me*   
*sit with me even if we haven't talked, I'm always c+h and liiike covering people*      

Most of my interests are typology, old games and movies. Less often I draw or make an intelligent look by reading super smart niche things. I'm too lazy to list it properly  
I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoiyuri~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, I just like when it known in advance

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, ultrakill, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc...  
sp; [movies](https://boxd.it/81CFL); spotify; steam; whiteboard

**Dni:**
basic, cancel culture, anyone who thinks that fiction effects reality, systems, serious rp, under 15. otherwise get freakyüíù 

Sometimes I hide or mute nearest people for 15 mins when there are too many dialog bubbles around. So know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment
