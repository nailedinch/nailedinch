***Larcis/Lars (–õ–∞—Ä—Ü–∏—Å/–õ–∞—Ä—Ü), or you can see people calling me Nin, 17***  
rus/self taught eng, so there's no such thing as grammar to me  
sit with me even if we haven't talked, i have permanent c+h and i looove covering people     

Most of my interests are typology, old games and movies. Less often I draw or make an intelligent look by reading super smart niche things. I'm too lazy to list it properly  
I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoiyuri~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, I just like when it known in advance

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, ultrakill, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc...  
[movies](https://boxd.it/81CFL); spotify; whiteboard

**Dni:**
basic, systems, under 15. otherwise get freakyüíú  
Sometimes I hide or mute nearest people for 15 mins when there are too many dialog bubbles around. So know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment
