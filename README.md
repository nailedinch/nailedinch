*rus/self taught eng, so there's no such thing as grammar to me*   
*sit with me even if we haven't talked, I'm always c+h and liiike covering people*      

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, ultrakill, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc...

I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoiyuri~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, just like when it known in advance

**Dni:**
basic, cancel culture, anyone who thinks that fiction effects reality, under 14. otherwise get freakyüíù 

Sometimes I hide or mute random people, so know that my invisible ass can land at you at any moment
