I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoiyuri~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, just like when it known in advance. multi and shipper btw

**Dni:**
basic, cancel culture, anyone who thinks that fiction effects reality, under 14. otherwise get freakyüíù 

Sometimes I hide or mute random people, so know that my invisible ass can land at you at any moment
