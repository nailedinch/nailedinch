I can't always read all your pages due to their unavailability in my country. My vpn has been working like shit lately.    

Most of my interests are typology, old games and movies. Less often I draw or make an intelligent look by reading super smart niche things. I'm too lazy to list it properly

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, ultrakill, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc...

[movies](https://boxd.it/81CFL); cute space for a spotify link; for a future sp


I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoiyuri~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, I just like when it known in advance


**Dni:**
basic, systems, under 16. otherwise get freaky💜

Sometimes I hide or mute nearest people for 15 mins when there are too many dialog bubbles around. So know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment
