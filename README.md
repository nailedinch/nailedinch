I can't always read your pages due to their unavailability in my country. My vpn has been working like shit lately, so if I come to you, but I'm on your dni or something, gently purr at me, I'm not doing this on purpose    
I follow friends and people with nice skins or profiles. You're my cool rocks collection, so don't mind me  

Most of my interests are typology, old games and movies. Less often I draw or make an intelligent look by reading super smart niche things. I'm too lazy to list it properly

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, ultrakill, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc...

[movies](https://boxd.it/81CFL); cute space for a spotify link


I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoi~ things, horror and gore, glitter and bows, but only in terms of fiction. Ily, all humans and inhumans, I just like when it known in advance


**Dni:**
basic, rp, systems, under 16. otherwise get freaky♥️

Sometimes I hide nearest people for 15 mins when there are too many dialog bubbles around. So know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment
